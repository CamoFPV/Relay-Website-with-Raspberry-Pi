# Relay-Website-with-Raspberry-Pi
This is my devlopment of my website that controls GPIO on the Pi to power any 16 channel relay.

To use this script, you have to have installed a LAMP server on the Pi.

Connect all 16 inputs from the relay board to the following pins in 5v, 2, 3, 4, 17, 27, 22, 10, 9, 11, 5, 6, 13, 19, 26, 21, 20, GND.

Im using a Raspberry Pi rev 2 B+ (Old Pi without video out) not sure if there is any diffrence on other Pis.
